My groupwork of the cource

I have finished some work about three month ago , 
but i just spend a short time on it , so it have many shortage.
Now i want to improve it , that is , add a function of register and login to replace the userId(model/user) ,
which i previously represented by ip+port , and it should be unique . 
The registering data will be saved in a txt file because i dont want to use data base . 
I will do that in the coming days . 

By the way , my program use java language and socketChannel which is asynchronous and based on TCP/IP Link.
Now it has three major functions:
1、chating one to one
2、chating in a room
3、chating in a ground(all people)
